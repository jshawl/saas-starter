# Ruby on Rails SaaS Starter Template

## Motivation

I'm tired of Frankensteining a bunch of existing code from other apps to create
new SaaS projects. I want to templatize all the things I usually add to new SaaS projects.

## Features / Includes

- Headless browser testing
- GitHub actions run tests
- rspec
- User model from devise
- postgres db

## Setup

1. Add a repository secret `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` on GitHub with the value from `config/master.key`
